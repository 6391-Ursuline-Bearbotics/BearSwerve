### BearSwerve

BearSwerve is intended to be an all in one swerve solution including: teleop driving, simulation, trajectory following and more.  It combines the work of [SDS swerve-lib](https://github.com/SwerveDriveSpecialties/swerve-lib), gerth2's [Swerve Sim](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/pull/3374), and [PathPlanner](https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner/releases)

### Vendor Dependancy

Bearswerve is intended to be used as a vendor dependancy.  It can be added using this online link: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/6391-Ursuline-Bearbotics/BearSwerve/master/BearSwerve.json`.  You need to also have the: NavX, PathPlanner, CTRE Phoenix, and REVLib dependencies even if you aren't using them.

### BearSwerve Support

While BearSwerve has currently only been tested on MK4 modules as mentioned above it borrows code from other established repositories and at least a portion of this code will probably make it into WPILib in the near future.

BearSwerve is intended and generic enough to support many different swerve modules and motor / hardware configurations with those modules.
